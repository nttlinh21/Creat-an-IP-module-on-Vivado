# Creat-an-IP-module-on-Vivado
Design an IP to find the smallest number between two numbers
Design and implement an IP on Vivado to compare two input numbers and determine the smallest value. This IP will be integrated into an FPGA system to support applications that require basic arithmetic processing. The design should create an IP block that compares two signed 8-bit numbers, with inputs being two signed integers (8 bits) and the output being the smaller value between the two input numbers.

For the project, you are required to build a UART communication program to transmit and receive two numbers from the user. The program should allow the user to input two numbers via the UART interface and display the result (the smallest value) on the terminal screen.

Ensure the IP design is optimized for FPGA resources, operates accurately, and provides full functionality in all cases.
